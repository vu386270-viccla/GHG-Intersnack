> **RUNE COMPLIANCE**: Before ANY code response, you MUST:
> 1. Classify this request (CODE_CHANGE | QUESTION | DEBUG | REVIEW | EXPLORE)
> 2. Route through the correct Rune skill (see skill-router routing table)
> 3. Follow the skill's workflow — do NOT freelance or skip steps
> Violation: writing code without skill routing = incorrect behavior.

## Platform Constraints

- MUST NOT: Never run commands containing hardcoded secrets, API keys, or tokens. Scan all shell commands for secret patterns before execution.
- MUST: After editing JS/TS files, ensure code follows project formatting conventions (Prettier/ESLint).
- MUST: After editing .ts/.tsx files, verify TypeScript compilation succeeds (no type errors).
- SHOULD: Monitor your context usage. If working on a long task, summarize progress before context fills up.
- MUST: Before summarizing/compacting context, save important decisions and progress to project files.
- SHOULD: Before ending, save architectural decisions and progress to .rune/ directory for future sessions.

## Purpose

Full codebase health assessment for legacy projects. Autopsy analyzes complexity, dependency coupling, dead code, tech debt, and git hotspots to produce a health score per module and a prioritized rescue plan. Uses opus for deep analysis quality.

## Called By (inbound)

- `rescue` (L1): Phase 0 RECON — assess damage before refactoring
- `onboard` (L2): when project appears messy during onboarding
- `audit` (L2): Phase 3 code quality and complexity assessment
- `incident` (L2): root cause analysis after containment

## Calls (outbound)

- `scout` (L2): deep structural scan — files, LOC, entry points, imports
- `research` (L3): identify if tech stack is outdated
- `trend-scout` (L3): compare against current best practices
- `journal` (L3): record health assessment findings

## Execution Steps

### Step 0 — Repo intelligence (if GitHub-hosted)

If the project is a GitHub repository, gather repo-level metrics before diving into code:

```bash
# Fetch via GitHub API (requires gh CLI or curl + GITHUB_TOKEN)
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo} --jq '{stars: .stargazers_count, forks: .forks_count, open_issues: .open_issues_count, license: .license.spdx_id, language: .language, topics: .topics, created: .created_at, pushed: .pushed_at}'

# Contributor count and top contributors
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/contributors --jq 'length' 
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/contributors --jq '.[0:5] | .[] | "\(.login): \(.contributions)"'

# Commit frequency (last 52 weeks)
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/stats/commit_activity --jq '[.[] | .total] | add'

# Language byte distribution
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/languages
```

Record in working notes:
- **Activity signal**: commits/week (>5 = active, 1-5 = maintained, <1 = stale)
- **Bus factor**: contributor count (1 = critical risk, 2-3 = low, >5 = healthy)
- **Community signal**: stars/forks ratio, open issue count, staleness of latest push

Skip this step for local-only projects with no remote.

### Step 1 — Structure scan

Call `the rune-scout skill` with a request for a full project map. Ask scout to return:
- All source files with LOC counts
- Entry points and main modules
- Import/dependency graph (who imports who)
- Test files and their coverage targets
- Config files (tsconfig, eslint, package.json, etc.)

### Step 2 — Module analysis

For each major module identified by scout, Read the file to open the file and assess:
- LOC (flag anything over 500 as a god file)
- Function count and average function length
- Maximum nesting depth (flag > 4 levels)
- Cyclomatic complexity signals (deep conditionals, many branches)
- Test file presence and estimated coverage

Record findings per module in a working table.

### Step 3 — Health scoring

Score each module 0-100 across six dimensions:

| Dimension | Weight | Scoring criteria |
|---|---|---|
| Complexity | 20% | Cyclomatic < 5 = 100, 5-10 = 70, 10-20 = 40, > 20 = 0 |
| Test coverage | 25% | > 80% = 100, 50-80% = 60, 20-50% = 30, < 20% = 0 |
| Documentation | 15% | README + inline comments = 100, partial = 50, none = 0 |
| Dependencies | 20% | Low coupling = 100, medium = 60, high/circular = 0 |
| Code smells | 10% | No god files, no deep nesting = 100, each violation -20 |
| Maintenance | 10% | Regular commits = 100, stale > 6 months = 50, untouched > 1yr = 0 |

Compute weighted score per module. Assign risk tier:
- 80-100 = healthy (green)
- 60-79 = watch (yellow)
- 40-59 = at-risk (orange)
- 0-39 = critical (red)

### Step 4 — Risk assessment

Run a shell command to gather git archaeology data:

```bash
# Most changed files (hotspots)
git log --format=format: --name-only | sort | uniq -c | sort -rg | head -20

# Files not touched in over a year
git log --before="1 year ago" --format="%H" | head -1 | xargs -I{} git diff --name-only {}..HEAD

# Authors per file (high author count = high churn risk)
git log --format="%an" -- <file> | sort -u | wc -l

# Commit velocity by month (trend detection)
git log --format="%Y-%m" | sort | uniq -c | tail -12

# Issue/PR close rate (GitHub only)
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues --jq '[.[] | select(.pull_request == null)] | length'
```

Identify:
- Circular dependencies (A imports B, B imports A)
- God files (> 500 LOC with many importers)
- Hotspot files (changed most often = highest bug density)
- Dead files (no importers, no recent commits)
- Velocity trend: accelerating, stable, or decelerating (compare last 3 months)

### Step 5 — Generate RESCUE-REPORT.md

Write/create the file to save `RESCUE-REPORT.md` at the project root with this structure:

```markdown
# Rescue Report: [Project Name]
Generated: [date]

## Overall Health: [score]/100

## Module Health
| Module | Score | Complexity | Coverage | Coupling | Risk | Priority |
|--------|-------|-----------|----------|----------|------|----------|
| [name] | [n]   | [low/med/high] | [%] | [low/med/high] | [tier] | [1-N] |

## Dependency Graph
[Mermaid flowchart of module coupling — use subgraphs for clusters]

## Language Distribution
[Mermaid pie chart — e.g., pie title Languages "TypeScript" : 65 "JavaScript" : 20 "CSS" : 15]

## Commit Velocity (Last 12 Months)
[Trend: accelerating / stable / decelerating — include monthly commit counts]

## Repo Intelligence (GitHub only)
| Metric | Value | Signal |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Stars | [n] | [community interest level] |
| Contributors | [n] | [bus factor: critical/low/healthy] |
| Open issues | [n] | [maintenance signal] |
| Commits/week | [n] | [activity: active/maintained/stale] |
| Last push | [date] | [freshness] |

## Surgery Queue (Priority Order)
1. [module] — Score: [n] — [primary reason] — Suggested pattern: [pattern]
2. ...

## Git Archaeology
- Hotspot files: [list with change frequency]
- Stale files: [list with age]
- Dead code candidates: [list]

## Immediate Actions (Before Surgery)
- [action 1]
- [action 2]
```

Call `the rune-journal skill` to record that autopsy ran, the overall health score, and the surgery queue.

### Step 6 — Report

Output a summary of the findings:

- Overall health score and tier
- Count of critical, at-risk, watch, and healthy modules
- Top 3 worst modules with scores and recommended patterns
- Confirm RESCUE-REPORT.md was saved
- Recommended next step: call `the rune-safeguard skill` on the top-priority module

## Confidence Scoring

Every finding in the autopsy report MUST carry a confidence level:

| Level | Range | Criteria |
|-------|-------|----------|
| High | 90-100% | Measured directly from code/git — LOC counted, tests run, deps parsed |
| Medium | 70-89% | Inferred from strong signals — file patterns, naming conventions, partial git data |
| Low | 50-69% | Estimated from weak signals — no git history, binary files, generated code |

Rules:
- Health scores backed by actual code metrics → High confidence
- Health scores using git archaeology only (no code read) → Medium confidence
- Health scores for modules where files couldn't be read (binary, encrypted, too large) → Low confidence
- **Overall report confidence** = weighted average of module confidences (by LOC weight)
- Include confidence in RESCUE-REPORT.md header: `Confidence: [High|Medium|Low] ([n]%)`

## Multi-Round Analysis

Autopsy follows a broad-to-narrow pattern to avoid missing systemic issues:

1. **Round 1 — Surface scan** (Steps 0-1): Repo metrics + structure map. Goal: identify scope and major clusters.
2. **Round 2 — Module deep dive** (Steps 2-3): Read and score each module. Goal: quantified health per module.
3. **Round 3 — Cross-cutting analysis** (Step 4): Git archaeology + dependency graph. Goal: find systemic risks invisible at module level (circular deps, hotspot clusters, bus factor).
4. **Round 4 — Synthesis** (Steps 5-6): Combine all rounds into prioritized report. Findings from later rounds may revise earlier scores.

Do NOT skip rounds. Round 3 cross-cutting analysis frequently reveals risks that per-module analysis misses (e.g., a "healthy" module that is the single point of failure for 10 others).

## Health Score Factors

```
CODE QUALITY    — cyclomatic complexity, nesting depth, function length
DEPENDENCIES    — coupling, circular deps, outdated packages
TEST COVERAGE   — line coverage, branch coverage, test quality
DOCUMENTATION   — inline comments, README, API docs
MAINTENANCE     — git hotspots, commit frequency, author count
DEAD CODE       — unused exports, unreachable branches
```

## Output Format

```
## Autopsy Report: [Project Name]

### Overall Health: [score]/100 — [tier: healthy | watch | at-risk | critical]

### Module Summary
| Module | Score | Risk | Priority |
|--------|-------|------|----------|
| [name] | [n]   | [tier] | [1-N] |

### Top Issues
1. [module] — [primary finding] — Recommended pattern: [pattern]

### Next Step
Run the rune-safeguard skill on [top-priority module] before any refactoring.
```

## Constraints

1. MUST scan actual code metrics — not estimate from file names
2. MUST produce quantified health score — not vague "needs improvement"
3. MUST identify specific modules with highest technical debt — ranked by severity
4. MUST NOT recommend refactoring everything — prioritize by impact
5. MUST check: test coverage, cyclomatic complexity, dependency freshness, dead code

## Sharp Edges

Known failure modes for this skill. Check these before declaring done.

| Failure Mode | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Health scores estimated without reading actual code metrics | CRITICAL | Constraint 1: scan actual code — open files, count LOC, assess nesting depth |
| Recommending refactoring everything without prioritization | HIGH | Constraint 4: rank by severity — worst health score modules first, max top-5 |
| Missing git archaeology (no hotspot/stale file analysis) | MEDIUM | Step 4 bash commands are mandatory — git log data is part of the health picture |
| Skipping RESCUE-REPORT.md write (only verbal summary) | HIGH | Step 5 write is mandatory — persistence is the point of autopsy |
| Health score not backed by all 6 dimensions scored | MEDIUM | All 6 dimensions (complexity, test coverage, docs, deps, smells, maintenance) required |

## Done When

- scout completed with full project map (all files, entry points, import graph)
- All major modules scored across all 6 dimensions
- Git archaeology run (hotspots, stale files, dead code candidates identified)
- RESCUE-REPORT.md written to project root with Mermaid dependency diagram
- journal called with health score and surgery queue
- Autopsy Report emitted with overall health tier and top-3 issues

## Returns

| Artifact | Format | Location |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Health score per module | Scored table (0-100) | inline |
| RESCUE-REPORT.md | Markdown + Mermaid | project root |
| Surgery queue (priority order) | Ordered list | RESCUE-REPORT.md |
| Git archaeology findings | Bash output + summary | inline |
| Journal entry | Text | via `journal` L3 |

## Cost Profile

~5000-10000 tokens input, ~2000-4000 tokens output. Opus for deep analysis. Most expensive L2 skill but runs once per rescue.

**Scope guardrail:** autopsy assesses — it does not refactor. All surgery is delegated to `surgeon` after the report is complete.

## Executive Mode (--executive)

When invoked as `/rune autopsy --executive`, generate a board-ready HTML health assessment. Requires Business tier.

### Executive Execution Steps

1. **Standard Autopsy**: Run Steps 1-5 (structure scan, module analysis, health scoring, risk assessment, RESCUE-REPORT.md)
2. **Org Context**: Read `.rune/org/org.md` for team structure and governance level
3. **Cross-Domain Impact**: Map module health to business domains (which team owns which modules)
4. **Business Risk Translation**: Convert technical health scores to business risk language:
   - Critical modules in revenue path → "Revenue infrastructure at risk"
   - Low test coverage on auth → "Security compliance gap"
   - High churn in customer-facing code → "Customer experience degradation risk"
5. **HTML Render**: Load `report-templates/autopsy-executive.html` from Business pack and populate all `{{placeholder}}` fields:
   - SVG health ring (score → stroke-dasharray calculation: `score / 100 * 440`)
   - Dimension bars (6 dimensions with color coding)
   - Module table (sorted by priority)
   - Surgery queue (top 5 modules)
   - Risk matrix (6 categories)
   - Git archaeology summary
   - Cross-domain impact table
   - Recommended actions (numbered, prioritized)
6. **Save**: Write HTML to `EXECUTIVE-HEALTH.html` at project root

### Executive Output

```
EXECUTIVE-HEALTH.html          — Board-ready HTML report
RESCUE-REPORT.md               — Detailed technical report (standard autopsy)
.rune/retros/{date}.json       — Health metrics for trend tracking
```

### Color Coding

| Score Range | Color | Tier |
|-------------|-------|------|
| 80-100 | var(--success) #10b981 | Healthy |
| 60-79 | var(--warning) #f59e0b | Watch |
| 40-59 | #f97316 (orange) | At-risk |
| 0-39 | var(--danger) #ef4444 | Critical |

### Graceful Degradation

- If no Business pack installed: skip executive mode, produce standard RESCUE-REPORT.md only
- If `.rune/org/org.md` missing: skip team mapping, show modules without domain ownership
- If org teams don't map to code modules: show "Unmapped" in cross-domain table
